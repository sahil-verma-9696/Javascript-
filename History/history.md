# History of JavaScript

![JavaScript History](https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)

JavaScript, a cornerstone of modern web development, has evolved significantly since its creation. Here's an overview of its history:

## **Creation at Netscape**

In September 1995, **Brendan Eich**, a newly hired developer at **Netscape Communications Corporation**, developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. Originally called **Mocha**, it was later renamed **LiveScript** and finally **JavaScript**. The language was designed to add interactivity to web pages, complementing HTML's static content. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## **Adoption by Microsoft**

In 1996, **Microsoft** introduced its own version of JavaScript called **JScript**, implemented in **Internet Explorer 3.0**. This led to compatibility issues between browsers, as each had its own interpretation of the language. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## **Standardization**

To address these inconsistencies, **Netscape** submitted JavaScript to **Ecma International** (formerly known as the **European Computer Manufacturers Association**) in November 1996, aiming to standardize the language. This resulted in the first edition of the **ECMAScript** standard, **ECMA-262**, adopted in June 1997. Subsequent editions, including **ECMAScript 2** in 1998 and **ECMAScript 3** in 1999, introduced further refinements. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## **Growth and Maturity**

The early 2000s saw a period of stagnation in client-side scripting, largely due to Microsoft's dominance in the browser market. However, the release of **Mozilla Firefox** in 2004 and **Google Chrome** in 2008, both featuring improved JavaScript engines, revitalized interest in the language. This led to the development of numerous libraries and frameworks, such as **jQuery**, **Prototype**, and **Dojo Toolkit**, which simplified and enhanced JavaScript development. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

In 2009, the release of **Node.js** enabled JavaScript to be used for server-side development, further expanding its applicability. The language has continued to evolve, with regular updates to the ECMAScript standard, introducing new features and improvements. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Today, JavaScript is a cornerstone of web development, powering interactive websites and applications across the internet.
